# Indian GDP Prediction and Analysis (1960-2022)

This repository contains the code and resources for predicting and analyzing Indian Gross Domestic Product (GDP) from the year 1960 to 2022. The analysis is based on a dataset with four columns: Year, Per capita GDP, Total GDP, and Growth rate. The Random Forest Classifier algorithm was used for this project.

## Dataset

### Data Source
The dataset used in this project is sourced from [insert data source/link].

### Data Description
- **Year**: The year for which the GDP data is recorded.
- **Per capita GDP**: The GDP per capita, which is the total GDP divided by the population.
- **Total GDP**: The total Gross Domestic Product of India for a specific year.
- **Growth rate**: The annual growth rate of the GDP.

## Dependencies

To run the code in this repository, you will need the following dependencies:

- Python 3.x
- pandas
- numpy
- scikit-learn
- matplotlib
- seaborn

You can install these dependencies using the following command:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage

1. Clone this repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/indian-gdp-prediction.git
```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

```bash
cd indian-gdp-prediction
```

3. Run the Jupyter Notebook or Python script to perform analysis and prediction:
